# Why Blog

It's a good question. I think the main thing for me is that sometimes there's thoughts that I have that I'd like to put _somewhere_ and I don't have a proper place for that yet. This could just as easily be an Obsidian notebook on my desktop (and maybe that makes more sense down the line), but I also want to play around with Static Site Generation a bit and this seems like a good excuse.

## The Audience

I think it's very important for any form of writing to have a clearly defined audience. For this blog my target audience is my future self. So if you're reading this and you're not actually me, know that this is a bit of a personal journal / diary so some posts may be missing some useful context. Hopefully this is still interesting to you even if you're not the target audience.

If you **are** the target audience: _hello me_!
